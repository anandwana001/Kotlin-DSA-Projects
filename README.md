- Time Complexity:
    - Minimax Algorithm: The complexity of Minimax in this implementation is \(O(9!)\) in the worst case due to the exhaustive nature of the algorithm, but it is optimized with the depth consideration.
    - Move Validations and Updates: Each move validation and update are \(O(1)\), making them highly efficient.
    - Win Condition Check: Each win check is \(O(1)\) for rows, columns, and diagonals.

- Space Complexity:
    - Board Representation: The 3x3 board uses a fixed amount of space \(O(1)\).
    - Minimax Recursion: Depth of the recursion is limited by the number of empty cells, leading to a space complexity of \(O(9)\).

- Data Structures:
    - 2D Array (`Array<CharArray>`): Efficiently represents the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
    - Primitive Counter (`emptyCells`): Keeps track of the number of empty cells on the board, optimizing the check for a full board.

- Algorithms:
    - Minimax Algorithm: Implements the Minimax algorithm for the AI player, considering depth to optimize decisions based on potential future moves. This ensures that the AI plays optimally.
    - Game Loop: Efficiently manages the game's progression.
    - Input Validation: Ensures valid player moves while handling invalid input gracefully.
    - Move Making: Updates the board state and decrements the `emptyCells` counter.
    - Win Condition Checking: Determines if a player has won by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.
    - Board Full Check: Optimized by using the `emptyCells` counter, reducing the need for repeated full-board scans.
    - Player Switching: Alternates player turns efficiently.
